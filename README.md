## A fun animated HTML5/CSS3 project

This is a project made as final thesis in the Advanced HTML5/CSS3 Course by Cimdata Academy. Was loads of fun to code, also challenging at times. Inspired by my course instructor (thank you Nico!), various awesome pens on Codepen and some great tutorials from all around the web.

These are also my first steps in Sass and CSS3 animations. Both super fun to work with! Looking forward to dig deeper into Sass and coding in general.

This project is also available on Codepen, without the sound files. Hope it inspires other people to play around with CSS3 animations. Constructive feedback and critics are always very welcome.
